# AI Forester Field Companion App

## Project Overview

The AI Forester Field Companion is a mobile application designed for forestry professionals who need to perform field calculations and assessments while working in remote areas. The app is specifically optimized for field use with offline functionality, battery conservation features, and interfaces designed for outdoor visibility.

Built with React Native and Expo, this app leverages AI capabilities to enhance traditional forestry calculations and provides a suite of field tools that help professionals make data-driven decisions directly from the field.

## Key Features

- **Offline Functionality**: All calculations and tools work without internet connection
- **Field Data Collection**: Capture and store field measurements efficiently
- **Culvert Sizing Tool**: Calculate proper culvert sizes based on watershed characteristics
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both iOS and Android devices
- **GPS Integration**: Capture location data for field cards
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional reports for documentation
- **Climate Adaptation**: Optional climate change projection factors
- **Low Battery Usage**: Optimized for extended field use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio or Xcode (for emulation/building)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidbeleznay/ai-forester-app.git
cd ai-forester-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

4. Run on a device or emulator:
   - Press 'a' for Android emulator
   - Press 'i' for iOS simulator
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your physical device

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following errors:

- **Gesture Handler not found**: Make sure `import 'react-native-gesture-handler'` is at the top of both `App.js` and `index.js` files.
- **TypeError: Cannot convert undefined value to object**: This usually indicates an issue with component props or state. Check that all objects have proper initialization.
- **Unable to resolve module**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

To fix common issues:
1. Clear Metro bundler cache: `expo start --clear`
2. Ensure gesture-handler is properly installed: `npm install react-native-gesture-handler --save`
3. Check that your Expo SDK version matches the dependencies in package.json

## Using the Culvert Sizing Tool

The Culvert Sizing Tool helps forestry professionals calculate the appropriate culvert size based on watershed characteristics and stream measurements.

### Features

- **Interactive Inputs**: Easy adjustment of watershed area and channel slope values
- **Real-time Calculations**: Dynamic calculation of cross-sectional area as you input stream measurements
- **Advanced Options**: Climate change projections and stream transportability considerations
- **Visual Results**: Clean, intuitive results display with visual representation of the culvert
- **Technical Recommendations**: Contextual recommendations based on culvert size and site conditions
- **PDF Reports**: Generate and share detailed reports with colleagues
- **GPS Location Tracking**: Add precise location data to field cards
- **Field Card Storage**: Save and recall field calculations for future reference

### How to Use

1. From the Home screen, tap on the "Culvert Sizing" button
2. Enter the required watershed information:
   - Watershed area (kmÂ²)
   - Precipitation region
   - Road type
   - Stream type
   - Stream gradient (%)
   - Road width (m)
3. Tap "Show Advanced Options" to access additional features:
   - Stream measurements (width and depth points)
   - Climate change projection adjustment
   - Field notes
   - GPS location capture
4. Tap "Calculate Culvert Size" to get your recommendation
5. The results screen will show:
   - Recommended culvert diameter or box dimensions
   - Visual representation of the culvert size with human scale reference
   - Flow calculations and capacity information
   - Transportability assessment
6. You can save the field card for future reference or export a PDF report
